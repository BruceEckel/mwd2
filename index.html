<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>Excuse me. I received a note saying that I needed to be here at 7:00.</h3>
<div style='border: 3px solid black; padding: 8px;'>
<h3><span style='color:Chocolate;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Y,M,tyfc. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Yes, Madge, thank you for coming.</span></h3></div>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>Can you tell me what this is all about?</h3>
<div style='border: 3px solid black; padding: 8px;'>
<h3><span style='color:Chocolate;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">W,Instty,M. Nlitbks,bjbttou,hatdhbrfwmEAy. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Well, I'm not supposed to tell you, Mr. Noir likes it to be kept secret, but just between the two of us, he's about to do his big reveal for who murdered Edward Angler yesterday.</span></h3></div>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>The big reveal! How thrilling!</h3>
<div style='border: 3px solid black; padding: 8px;'>
<h3><span style='color:Chocolate;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Wylad? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Would you like a drink?</span></h3></div>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>No, thank you. (As she finds what she hopes is the best seat for the reveal) I've heard how Detective Prometheus Noir's big reveals are top-notch entertainment!</h3>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(MADGE opens her purse and pulls a bag of popcorn out of it. She eats popcorn throughout the scene. JOHNNY pours himself a drink. Enter the PROFESSOR and ADELINE. The PROFESSOR carries a messenger bag which he sets at one end of the couch on stage. ADELINE has a purse that she keeps with her at all times.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>What's all this then?</h3>
<div style='border: 3px solid black; padding: 8px;'>
<h3><span style='color:Chocolate;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">H,P,M. A-M. Nwltste. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Hello, Professor, Ms. Adeline - Mr. Noir would like to speak to everyone.</span></h3></div>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>We're on vacation! How many times do we need to answer questions to that silly detective.</h3>
<div style='border: 3px solid black; padding: 8px;'>
<h3><span style='color:Chocolate;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">H,n-PNitgditw! &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Hey, now - Prometheus Noir is the greatest detective in the world!</span></h3></div>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>You are very loyal to your employer.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(Enter LIONEL.)</span></h3>

<h3><span style='color:Chocolate;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">(A)Ty! Wylad? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">(TO ADELINE) Thank you! Would you like a drink?</span></h3></div>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>I would.</h3>

<h3><span style='color:Chocolate;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">S,L,Iayabty. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Sorry, Lionel, I'm afraid you're a bit too young.</span></h3></div>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>My father died yesterday. That means that I'm a man now.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(LIONEL gets up on stage and tries to grab a drink. JOHNNY doesn't let him. LIONEL gives up and plops down in a chair. ADELINE and the PROFESSOR both get a drink from the tray and sit down. Enter MADAM MAPLE from the porch.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>This room is full of darkness.</h3>
<div style='border: 3px solid black; padding: 8px;'>
<h3><span style='color:Chocolate;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">O,MM-s,bisyshyso. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Oh, Madam Maple - sorry, but it seems you still have your sunglasses on.</span></h3></div>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>Right. I predict that Prometheus Noir will be the next person to enter this room.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(Everyone stops and looks for PROMETHEUS to enter. A waiter enters, grabs a drink and leaves again. They all look at MADAM MAPLE.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>(CONT) It must be the altitude.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(JOHNNY offers the tray of drinks to MADAM MAPLE. She sits.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>I cannot believe it is snowing in June.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>Oh goody, are we talking about the weather right before we get accused of murder?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>Ok, what is an appropriate topic of conversation to have before one is accused of murder?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>I don't know. This is my first time. Hey... little detective.</h3>
<div style='border: 3px solid black; padding: 8px;'>
<h3><span style='color:Chocolate;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">O,ymm? W,t,IaIAaa,Ik-a-h. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Oh, you mean me? Well, technically, I'm an Investigative Assistant and also, I'm kind-of above-average height.</span></h3></div>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>Right, what should we talk about?</h3>
<div style='border: 3px solid black; padding: 8px;'>
<h3><span style='color:Chocolate;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">S-Isyctaayl. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Sorry - I suppose you can talk about anything you like.</span></h3></div>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>Maybe it's a test.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>There's no test if you aren't the murderer.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>Are you implying that I am?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>You're implying that you are.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>I am not.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>I know what we can talk about: me! You know, when I was a kid-</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>(INTERRUPTING) You mean today?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>(CONTINUING) I would write myself coded messages. For example, A=1, B=2, C=3 and so on. So if I wanted to say hat, I would write out 8.1.20.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>What are you talking about?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>The Detective's sidekick wouldn't tell us what to talk about so I'm talking about my favorite subject - me!</h3>
<div style='border: 3px solid black; padding: 8px;'>
<h3><span style='color:Chocolate;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">W,m1---------. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Well, maybe 19-8-8-8-8-8-8-8-8-8.</span></h3></div>

<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>No, you're telling me to hoooooooooo.</h3>
<div style='border: 3px solid black; padding: 8px;'>
<h3><span style='color:Chocolate;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">()Tcbr. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">(thinks) That can't be right.</span></h3></div>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(There is a crescendo of noise as all the characters try to figure out how to say "Shhhhh" in numbers. PROMETHEUS NOIR enters by the bar.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>I would like to thank you all for coming.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(PROMETHEUS takes very small steps to get up to the stage. He nods at the audience members as he passes them and says things like "Bonjour. You are right, it is I.")</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>It's not like we were given much of a choice, old boy.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>We are here to get at the truth of the murder of Edward Angler.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(JOHNNY offers the drink tray to PROMETHEUS.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>His death was an accident.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>Just like the death of your husband was an accident.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>Yes. Men get themselves killed accidentally all the time. It's very inconvenient.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>But Mr. Angler did not think the death of your husband was an accident.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>Edward was a contrarian. Besides, he slipped in the river while fishing.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>No! It was a very cold and calculated murder.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(Shifty eyes from EVERYONE.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>If you are going to make wild speculations, I feel compelled to tell you what your future is.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(MADAM MAPLE pulls out a Tarot Deck and shuffles it.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>I am trying to explain a murder.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>Yes, could you please tell us who did it.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>I will get to that. There is an order in which I like to reveal the information. To paint the story.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>(pulling a card) Look at that - The Fool. That's you. Very fitting.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>Please do not read my tarot cards. I do not believe in such nonsense.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(MADAM MAPLE pulls out the next card.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>I can see why you tried to stop me.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>Madam -</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>The Gonorrhea card.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(MADAM MAPLE shows everyone the card.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>I did not know they had a card for that.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>What's the point of knowing the future if you don't know whether or not you'll have gonorrhea.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>We are discussing a murder!</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>The death of your sex life.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>Can you please shut up!</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>So what? Now you're going to tell us it was the Butler in the library?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>Instead of having the snow storm hinder them from committing the murder, they used it to frame a limited amount of suspects.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>You mean us.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>Naturel, since you are the only ones who went out fishing in the snow storm. It allows us to eliminate them. (PROMETHEUS gestures at the audience.) But perhaps this entire set up was an illusion and certain events happened before they happened.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>Excusez-moi, but I am confused.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(PROMETHUES takes a sip of his drink.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>Nobody can blame you, my dear, he is talking in circles on purpose. He is showing off so that we all get caught up in how clever he is.</h3>
<div style='border: 3px solid black; padding: 8px;'>
<h3><span style='color:Chocolate;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Hy-yssdr. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Hey you - you show some darn respect.</span></h3></div>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>I do not need for you to stick up for me. No, I, Prometheus Noir, never need to prove how clever I am because my cleverness is me.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>Maybe it's a French thing!</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>I am not French! I am Belgian!  (coughs)</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>I wouldn't go shouting that from the roofs. Especially if you're a Walloon.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>You can't blame him, shouting is very European.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>I would not call it a French trait.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>I'm sorry, it was just a little joke.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>The French do not need to shout.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>I find that an interesting remark for you to make Madam.  (coughs)</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>Anybody want to take bets on who the murderer is? 2/1 odds it's the creepy kid.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>Said the man who keeps hitting on the French gal half his age.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>You are very open with your betting considering your gambling debts.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>I bet you a nickel that I don't have any gambling debts!</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>It cannot hurt that Edward Angler, the man to whom you owed a substantial amount of money, is now dead.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>How dare you! Eddie was a good a friend of mine, the reason I owed him money was because I used to owe money to some unsavory people and he paid it off. He would have done it as a gift but I insisted it was a loan. Why would I kill him?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>Unsavory people? You mean gangsters? How thrilling!</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>Ummmmm...yes. Sort of. More just loans with high interest rates, really.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>Shame.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>I did hear that one of the lenders had a cousin who dated a girl whose older brother was a gangster.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>Ooooo la la.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>Focus! Money is always a great motive. Bien, Lionel and Madam Maple would also benefit financially from his death.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>Kill my own Father?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>There seems to be no great love lost. Your Father is dead and yet you are still here. Not letting a small thing like his death interrupt your holiday.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>Some things in life are more important than death. Like fishing.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>N'est-ce pas.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>I can't argue in French, if you could, please, accuse me in English.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>Mr. Angler was going to expose you as a fraud! (coughs)</h3>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(MADAM MAPLE pulls another card.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>Another Gonorrhea card! That's strange, there's only one in the deck.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>So you were not worried that Mr. Angler was going to destroy your business?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>Mr. Noir, if I killed every mediocre man who threatened my business, I would have to be an exhausted serial killer with no end in sight.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>And you were not worried about your reputation?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>There are those that believe in the gift and those that don't. There will always be skeptics that try to undermine you.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>But most of those people do not yield the same power over you.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>The fact that you believe that, at my age, I am capable of murdering a grown man, is flattering. Thank you for including me.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>I wouldn't feel too flattered, he seems to be including everyone.</h3>
<div style='border: 3px solid black; padding: 8px;'>
<h3><span style='color:Chocolate;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Hn,ssr,p-mbciieas. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Hey now, show some respect, please - my boss clearly isn't including everyone as suspects.</span></h3></div>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(JOHNNY gestures to the audience.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>Oh yes, I can't imagine that it was too hard to eliminate those people.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>I would not gain anything financially from his death.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>Me neither.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>This is very true Mesdemoiselles, but financial gain is not the only motive for murder. No, the most powerful motive is governed by the affairs of the heart. (coughs)</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>I was his secretary, nothing more.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>And I only just met him.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>But can you deny that American men find French women irresistible?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>This is my first time in America-</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>(INTERRUPTING) But did he not find out information from your past? Information that you would want to keep secret?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>There is nothing in my past that I would murder over. (pulls purse in closer)</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>Me neither.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>But you admit that Mr. Angler never tried to sleep with you.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>No!</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>You do admit he tried to sleep with you?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>No?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>No you don't admit he tried it or no he didn't try it?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>Sorry, yes. Meaning no.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>Even though he slept with every secretary before you.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>That's the rumor.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>That's the truth!  (coughs)</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>I didn't apply to be his secretary hoping that he would sleep with me.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>You did not feel slighted by him?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>No, I found it very refreshing to file papers without any sexual harassment.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>And what about the rest of you? (Coughs) Would you be susceptible to blackmail?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>My father was a lot of things - a womanizer, he wore brown shoes with black belts, he loved Hitler - but he was not a blackmailer!</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>That is true! (Coughs) But after murder, blackmail is the most vile crime a human can commit (coughs) for it perverts the course of justice (coughs). It values greed over the truth! I can not stand by -</h3>

<h3><span style='color:black;'>(The PROFESSOR moves over to the library and tries to distract himself with books. LIONEL gets his tea.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>I will never get over this shock if all I have to drink is tea.</h3>

<h3 class="hintcode">Wdyshayfd? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Why did you stay here after your father died?</span></h3></div>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>

<div style='border: 3px solid black; padding: 8px;'>
<h3><span style='color:Chocolate;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Dyegratq? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Do you ever give real answers to questions?</span></h3></div>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>I suppose I'm just not ready to face it.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>But this is where it happened. I would think this place would be a constant reminder of his death.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>No, that's not what I mean. You see, when I go home, I will inherit everything. That means that I will have to run the business, take charge of the household, do all those things that are expected of me. So I thought, what if I finish my vacation? Just put all of that off for a few more days. Put off reality by staying in Almont.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>I can understand that.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>Can you believe some people live here?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(LIONEL laughs like this is the funniest joke he's ever thought of. He joins the PROFESSOR by the library.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>(CONT) I'm all alone now. No more family left. Well, no more family that I'm aware of.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>What does that mean?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>Well, father certainly did love his secretaries. And he and mother would have terrible fights when she was alive. When she died, I would catch the odd glimpse here and there of someone leaving the house at all sorts of hours in the morning. But, I was never informed of any out-of-wedlock siblings running around. Did he ever try something with you Miss McGills?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>No.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>That doesn't sound like my father at all. Are you sure you're not hiding something?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>No... although, sometimes I would catch him staring at me.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>Just staring wasn't his style, he wasn't shy.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>I was warned before I took the job, he has a reputation but when I caught him staring at me, he would look away quickly, like he had been caught doing something wrong. I always thought he was about to say something but he never did.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>Curiouser and curiouser. My father was many things, but subtle wasn't one of them. One time we were at this really fancy restaurant and when the waitress came to our table he said "Do you like raisins? How do you feel about a date?"</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>So corny. One time I heard him say "Is your name Winnie the Pooh? Because you're giving me Hundred Acre Wood."</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>When he arrived here, he said to me "If I could rearrange the alphabet, I'd put "U and I together."</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>He told me, "Are you a beaver because - Damn!"</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>Back to me! Of course, the waitress left and got the manager - well, it turned out my Dad owned the restaurant, and everyone ends up apologizing to him. I think he ended up dating the waitress for a couple of months, which is serious for him.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>You can ask anyone at the firm, everyone thought it was the oddest thing. Other women started asking me to bring their work to him. Any other woman that went to the office would have all sorts of problems the minute they walked through the door.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>Just think, maybe he was in love with you. If he had stayed vertical a little longer, you could be my new step-Mama. Instead, it's just me and the business.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>Aren't you a bit young to take over the business?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>I'm old enough to tell my lawyer to sell it and give me all the money.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>That would put hundreds of people out of work.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>Yes that would be sad for them. Good thing I'll have all that money to cheer me up.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>But don't you have an allowance?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>Yes, but if I sold the whole business... I could really make a splash! I could start up my own fashion design line. Zig Zags for everyone. Asymmetry is in. Haute couture, Darling, Haute couture.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>I didn't realize you were a fashion designer.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>I'm not but if you have enough money, you can be anything you like. And I want to be surrounded, by beauty. Which means I wouldn't spend any more time with the likes of you.</h3>

<h3>And how do we do that?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>

<h3>Me too.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>Me three - was he blackmailing all of us?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>He wasn't blackmailing me, just told me to give him lots of money in exchange for his silence.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>That's blackmail.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>But he wasn't a very good blackmailer, he was airing all our dirty secrets before he died.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>Probably because we didn't give him the money.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>But blackmail is usually a long term plan, you don't threaten someone with blackmail one day and reveal the information the next. It doesn't make sense. Maybe someone overheard the interviews he was doing and used that as an opportunity to make some money.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>

<h3>And moi.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>I keep forgetting you're here.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>I told you I was not the murderer.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>Does this mean you aren't Canadian?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>Why would it mean that?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>A man can dream.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>Johnny left and found out the body was missing. We all ran around.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(EVERYONE runs around the tables.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>(CONT) Then Lionel got stabbed...</h3>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(MADGE exits through fireplace door then reenters screaming and running. EVERYONE chases after her.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>(CONT) ... and died...</h3>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(MADGE falls into the PROFESSOR'S arms in the library.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>... pointing out the library to us one more time.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>He could have just told us who stabbed him.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>(she pops out of the Professor's arms) We examined the wound, (loosely slapping Johnny in the face, mimicking the blood spray) and found out that the killer was left handed. Next, we discovered that Adeline was Canadian.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>Which is not a bad thing. At least I am not a sex maniac or bad at gambling.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>(SIMULTANEOUSLY) I am not ashamed of my lifestyle.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>(SIMULTANEOUSLY) I betcha being in debt is better than being Canadian.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>Adeline was rightfully tied up and ended up...</h3>

<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>In which we did not learn a thing.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>Eh, I'll give you that one.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>Then Johnny and I were at the library...</h3>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(EVERYONE runs to the library.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>(CONT) ... and Johnny tossed his wallet to the Professor.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(JOHNNY tosses his wallet at the PROFESSOR. It hits him again.)</span></h3>

<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>And we all left except Adeline, who was over here...</h3>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(EVERYONE runs to the chair by the fireplace door. MADGE flings ADELINE into the chair again.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>That's when I figured out what chat meant!</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>But someone hit you on the head!</h3>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(The PROFESSOR grabs the candlestick and tosses it to MADGE, who hits ADELINE on the head.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>Owwwww. I already have a concussion.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>Now you have two.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>And with the scrap piece of paper, we were all forgetting one important fact: Mr. Noir was French.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>EVERYONE ELSE</span></h3>
<h3>Belgian.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>Thank you. But the note was in French.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>EVERYONE ELSE</span></h3>
<h3>Belgian.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>No, I speak French.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>Make up your mind.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>And since the note was in French, the French-Canadian was able to figure out the clue before any of the rest of us.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>Chat means cat.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>The cat did it?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>No.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>I assume that somehow the cat thing refers to Madam Maple.</h3>

<h3><span style='color:Chocolate;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Wmyst? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">What makes you say that?</span></h3></div>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>Because she's kind of a cougar.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>Me-ow, being accused of murder at my age is quite thrilling, but then again, anything at my age is quite thrilling.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>So you thought putting the word chat - not meaning chat - but meaning cat would be enough of a hint for us to solve the murder?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>Bien sur. How much more could you possibly need?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>You're awfully smug for a man who has been playing dead for the last hour. Besides, we did figure it out without you.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>Who do you think did it?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>Madge.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>C'mon, I'm painting a picture. And with talk all night of Mr. Angler having other children who were not Lionel... I think it's pretty obvious who the murderer is.</h3>

<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>Well, you see, I'm an orphan.</h3>

<h3>No - Edward Angler was our father. We're half-siblings. Lionel also realized you were his brother when you said you had webbed feet, because so did he - that's why he dropped the book on his head and why he reacted to feet so strongly. And left his code in the library.</h3>
