<h2>SCENE ONE</h2>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>Excuse me. I received a note saying that I needed to be here at 6:30.</h3>
<div style='border: 3px solid black; padding: 8px;'>
<h3><span style='color:Chocolate;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Y,tyfc. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Yes, thank you for coming.</span></h3></div>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>Can you tell me what this is all about?</h3>
<div style='border: 3px solid black; padding: 8px;'>
<h3><span style='color:Chocolate;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">W,Instty,M. Nlitbks,bjbttou,hatdhbrfwmEAy. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Well, I'm not supposed to tell you, Mr. Noir likes it to be kept secret, but just between the two of us, he's about to do his big reveal for who murdered Edward Angler yesterday.</span></h3></div>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>The big reveal! How thrilling!</h3>
<div style='border: 3px solid black; padding: 8px;'>
<h3><span style='color:Chocolate;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Wylad? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Would you like a drink?</span></h3></div>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>No thank you. (As she finds what she hopes is the best seat for the reveal) I've heard how Detective Prometheus Noir's big reveals are top-notch entertainment!</h3>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(MADGE opens her purse and pulls a bag of popcorn out of it. She eats popcorn throughout the scene. JOHNNY pours himself a drink. Enter the PROFESSOR and ADELINE. ADELINE has a purse that she keeps with her at all times.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>What's all this then?</h3>
<div style='border: 3px solid black; padding: 8px;'>
<h3><span style='color:Chocolate;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">M. Nwltste. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Mr. Noir would like to speak to everyone.</span></h3></div>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>We're on vacation! How many times do we need to answer questions to that silly detective.</h3>
<div style='border: 3px solid black; padding: 8px;'>
<h3><span style='color:Chocolate;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">PNitgditw! &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Prometheus Noir is the greatest detective in the world!</span></h3></div>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>You are very loyal to your employer.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(Enter LIONEL.)</span></h3>
<div style='border: 3px solid black; padding: 8px;'>
<h3><span style='color:Chocolate;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">(A)Wylad? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">(TO ADELINE) Would you like a drink?</span></h3></div>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>I would.</h3>
<div style='border: 3px solid black; padding: 8px;'>
<h3><span style='color:Chocolate;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Yty. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">You're too young.</span></h3></div>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>My father died yesterday. That means that I'm a man now.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(LIONEL gets up on stage and tries to grab a drink. JOHNNY doesn't let him. LIONEL gives up and plops down in a chair. ADELINE and the PROFESSOR both get a drink and sit down. Enter MADAM MAPLE from the porch.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>This room is full of darkness.</h3>
<div style='border: 3px solid black; padding: 8px;'>
<h3><span style='color:Chocolate;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Yshyso. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">You still have your sunglasses on.</span></h3></div>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>Right. I predict that Prometheus Noir will be the next person to enter this room.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(Everyone stops and looks for PROMETHEUS to enter. A waiter enters, grabs a drink and leaves again. They all look at MADAM MAPLE.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>It must be the altitude.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(JOHNNY hands MADAM MAPLE a drink. She sits.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>I can not believe it is snowing in June.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>Oh goody, are we talking about the weather right before we get accused of murder?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>Ok, what is an appropriate topic of conversation to have before one is accused of murder?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>I don't know. This is my first time. Hey, little detective.</h3>
<div style='border: 3px solid black; padding: 8px;'>
<h3><span style='color:Chocolate;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Ayttm? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Are you talking to me?</span></h3></div>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>Yes, what should we talk about?</h3>
<div style='border: 3px solid black; padding: 8px;'>
<h3><span style='color:Chocolate;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Yctaayl. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">You can talk about anything you like.</span></h3></div>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>Maybe it's a test.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>There's no test if you aren't the murderer.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>Are you implying that I am?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>You're implying that you are.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>I am not.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>You know, when I was a kid, I would write myself coded messages. You know, A=1, B=2, C=3 and so on. So if I wanted to say cat, I would write out 3.1.20.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>What are you talking about?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>The Detective's sidekick wouldn't tell us what to talk about so I'm talking about my favorite subject - me!</h3>
<div style='border: 3px solid black; padding: 8px;'>
<h3><span style='color:Chocolate;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">1---------. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">19-8-8-8-8-8-8-8-8-8.</span></h3></div>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>What are you talking about?</h3>
<div style='border: 3px solid black; padding: 8px;'>
<h3><span style='color:Chocolate;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Itytsiyc. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">I'm telling you to shhhhhhh in your code.</span></h3></div>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>No, you're telling me to hoooooooooo.</h3>
<div style='border: 3px solid black; padding: 8px;'>
<h3><span style='color:Chocolate;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Tcbr. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">That can't be right.</span></h3></div>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(There is a crescendo of noise as all the characters try to figure out how to say Shhhhh in numbers. PROMETHEUS NOIR enters by the bar.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>I would like to thank you all for coming.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(PROMETHEUS takes very small steps to get up to the stage. He nods at the audience members as he passes them.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>It's not like we were given much of a choice, old boy.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>We are here to get at the truth of the murder of Edward Angler.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(JOHNNY hands PROMETHEUS a drink.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>His death was an accident.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>Just like the death of your husband was an accident.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>Yes. Men get themselves killed accidentally all the time. It's very inconvenient.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>But Mr. Angler did not think the death of your husband was an accident.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>He was a contrarian. Besides, Edward slipped in the river while fishing.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>No! It was a very cold and calculated murder.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>If you are going to make wild speculations, I feel compelled to tell you what your future is.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(MADAM MAPLE pulls out a Tarot Deck.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>I am trying to explain a murder.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>Yes, could you please tell us who did it.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>I will get to that. There is an order in which I like to reveal the information. To paint the story.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>Look at that - The Fool. That's you. Very fitting.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>Please do not read my tarot cards. I do not believe in such nonsense.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(MADAM MAPLE pulls out the next card.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>I can see why you tried to stop me.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>Madam -</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>The Gonorrhea card.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(MADAM MAPLE shows everyone the card.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>I did not know they had a card for that.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>What's the point of knowing the future if you don't know if you'll have gonorrhea.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>We are discussing a murder!</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>The death of your sex life.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>Can you please shut up!</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>So what? Now you're going to tell us it was the Butler in the library?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>Instead of having the snow storm hinder them from committing the murder, they used it to frame a limited amount of suspects.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>You mean us.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>Naturel, since you are the only ones who went out fishing in the snowstorm. It allows us to eliminate them.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(PROMETHEUS gestures at the audience.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>(CONT.) But perhaps this entire set up was an illusion and certain events happened before they happened.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>Excusez-moi but I am confused.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(PROMETHUES takes a sip of his drink.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>Nobody can blame you, my dear, he is talking in circles on purpose. He is showing off so that we all get caught up in how clever he is.</h3>
<div style='border: 3px solid black; padding: 8px;'>
<h3><span style='color:Chocolate;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Yssr! &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">You show some respect!</span></h3></div>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>I do not need for you to stick up for me. No, I, Prometheus Noir, never need to prove how clever I am because my cleverness is me.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>Maybe it's a French thing!</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>I am not French! I am Belgian!  (coughs)</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>I wouldn't go shouting that from the roofs.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>You can't blame him, shouting is very European.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>I would not call it a French trait.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>I'm sorry, of course not, it was just a little joke.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>The French do not need to shout.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>I find that an interesting remark for you to make Madam.  (coughs)</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>Anybody want to take bets on who the murderer is? 2/1 odds its the creepy kid.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>Said the man who keeps hitting on the French gal half his age.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>You are very open with your betting considering your gambling debts.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>I bet you a nickel that I don't have any gambling debts!</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>It cannot hurt that Edward Angler, the man to whom you owed a substantial amount of money, is now dead.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>How dare you! Eddie was a good a friend of mine, the reason I owed him money was because I used to owe money to some unsavory people and he paid it off. He would have done it as a gift but I insisted it was a loan. Why would I kill him?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>Unsavory people? You mean gangsters? How thrilling!</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>Ummmmm...yes. Sort of. More just loans with high interest rates, really.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>Shame.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>I did hear that one of the lenders had a cousin who dated a girl whose older brother was a gangster.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>Ooooo la la.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>Focus! Money is always a great motive. Bien, Lionel and Madam Maple would also benefit financially from his death.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>Kill my own Father?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>There seems to be no great love lost. Your Father is dead and yet you are still here. Not letting a small thing like his death interrupt your holiday.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>Some things in life are more important than death. Like fishing.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>N'est-ce pas.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>I can't argue in French, if you could, please, accuse me in English.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>Mr. Angler was going to expose you as a fraud! (coughs)</h3>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(MADAM MAPLE pulls another card.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>Another gonorrhea card! That's strange, there's only one in the deck.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>So you were not worried that Mr. Angler was going to destroy your business.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>Mr. Noir, if I killed every mediocre man who threatened my business, I would have to be an exhausted serial killer with no end in sight.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>And you were not worried about your reputation.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>There are those that believe in the gift and those that don't. There will always be skeptics that try to undermine you.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>But most of those people do not yield the same power over you.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>The fact that you believe that, at my age, I am capable of murdering a grown man, is flattering. Thank you for including me.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>I wouldn't feel too flattered, he seems to be including everyone.</h3>
<div style='border: 3px solid black; padding: 8px;'>
<h3><span style='color:Chocolate;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Ssr,mbciieas. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Show some respect, my boss clearly isn't including everyone as suspects.</span></h3></div>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(JOHNNY gestures to the audience.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>Oh yes, I can't imagine that it was too hard to eliminate those people.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>I would not gain anything financially from his death.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>Me neither.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>This is very true Mademoiselles, but financial gain is not the only motive for murder. No, the most powerful motive is governed by the affairs of the heart. (coughs)</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>I was his secretary, nothing more.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>And I only just met him.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>But can you deny that men find French women irresistible?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>This is my first time in America -</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>But did he not find out information from your past? Information that you would want to keep secret?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>There is nothing in my past that I would murder over.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>Me neither.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>But you admit that Mr. Angler never tried to sleep with you.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>I do.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>Even though he slept with every secretary before you.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>That's the rumor.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>That's the truth!  (coughs)</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>I didn't apply to be his secretary hoping that he would sleep with me.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>You did not feel slighted by him?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>No, I found it very refreshing to file papers without any sexual harassment.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>And what about the rest of you? (Coughs) Would you be susceptible to blackmail?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>My father was a lot of things but he was not a blackmailer!</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>That is true! (Coughs) But after murder, blackmail may be one of the most vile crimes a human can commit (coughs) for it perverts the course of justice (coughs). It values greed over the truth! I can not stand by -</h3>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(PROMETHEUS drops down to one knee.)</span></h3>
<div style='border: 3px solid black; padding: 8px;'>
<h3><span style='color:Chocolate;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">S! Ayo? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Sir! Are you ok?</span></h3></div>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(JOHNNY runs up to help him but he waves him away.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>I will not -</h3>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(PROMETHEUS begins to spit up blood. All the other characters get up to huddle around him. PROMETHEUS has one more gasp and dies. MADGE checks his pulse.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>He's dead.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>If only men could get to the point.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(MADAM MAPLE takes a sip of her drink.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>He must have been poisoned.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(MADAM MAPLE spits her drink into JOHNNY's face. JOHNNY pauses and opens his mouth to let the liquid in his mouth fall into his glass. The PROFESSOR licks his hand to get any liquid residue off. ADELINE faints back on the couch. MADGE stops eating her popcorn and drops her hand back down, realizes that her popcorn was from her purse and starts eating it again.)</span></h3>

<div style='border: 3px solid black; padding: 8px;'>
<h3><span style='color:Chocolate;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>

<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>I trained to be a nurse for a while but I wasn't cut out for it. Mr. Pearson, you were his assistant, can you tell us who the murderer is?</h3>

<h3><span style='color:Chocolate;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">U,n. Hltkisfhbr. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Unfortunately, no. He loved to keep it secret for his big reveal.</span></h3></div>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>If only he had told you, his secrecy might have cost him his life. Or maybe it was just all that gonorrhea.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>Now what?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>I suppose we review the facts and the clues that we are aware of and try to deduce the killer ourselves.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>Makes sense.</h3>
<div style='border: 3px solid black; padding: 8px;'>
<h3><span style='color:Chocolate;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>

<h3>We are reasonably intelligent people.</h3>

<h3>No.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>We aren't reasonably intelligent people?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>Yes.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>Yes we are reasonably intelligent people or no we aren't reasonably intelligent people?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>I meant no, it's not a good idea. We should just wait for the police.</h3>

<h3><span style='color:Chocolate;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Bts,wdkwtcb. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">But the storm, we don't know when that could be.</span></h3></div>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>Exactly. I am going to assume that the reason that your boss was killed is that he had figured out who the murderer is. So if the murderer begins to feel threatened by any of us, that will give him the motivation-</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>-Or her-</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>My apologies, or her, that he  -</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>Or she.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>Or she, need to kill the rest of us.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>Or maybe you just don't want us to find out that it was you.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>You believe what you want. I, for one, don't feel like being murdered on a fishing trip so I am going to drink and mind my own business.

It's only that I would love to talk to you about the Hundred Years' War and the effect it had on strengthening French nationalism.</h3>

<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>We should put it somewhere cold.</h3>

<h3>The freezer?</h3>

<h3>The fish we caught are in there.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>Good point.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>I caught a nice wild brown trout today.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>And I caught a lovely Northern Pike.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>You can't catch those here.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>I'm sorry, it's my English.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>Of course.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>What about by the river? It's snowing out, it should stay cold.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>Wildlife might eat it.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>I guess it will have to be the freezer.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(They consider; everyone would rather keep their fish than worry about the body.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>What are the chances any wildlife is in the area?</h3>

<h3>Old enough.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>Only people who are too young say that. Get him a tea with extra honey.</h3>

<h3>Professor, would you consider yourself a sex maniac?</h3>

<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>Well, my dear, I wouldn't put it quite like that. Excuse me.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(The PROFESSOR moves over to the library and tries to distract himself with books. LIONEL gets his tea.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>I will never get over this shock if all I have to drink is tea.</h3>
<div style='border: 3px solid black; padding: 8px;'>
<h3><span style='color:Chocolate;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Wdyshayfd? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Why did you stay here after your father died?</span></h3></div>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>Because I'm in shock and the most helpful thing anyone can do is give me tea.</h3>
<div style='border: 3px solid black; padding: 8px;'>
<h3><span style='color:Chocolate;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Dyegratq? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Do you ever give real answers to questions?</span></h3></div>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>I suppose I'm just not ready to face it.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>But this is where it happened. I would think this place would be a constant reminder of his death.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>No, that's not what I mean. You see, when I go home, I will inherit everything. That means that I will have to run the business, take charge of the household, do all those things that are expected of me. So I thought, what if I finish my vacation? Just put all of that off for a few more days. Put off reality by staying in Almont.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>I can understand that.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>Can you believe some people live here?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(LIONEL laughs like this is the funniest joke he's ever thought of. He joins the PROFESSOR by the library.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>I'm all alone now. No more family left. Well, no more family that I'm aware of.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>What does that mean?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>Well, father certainly did love his secretaries. And he and mother would have terrible fights when she was alive. When she died, I would catch the odd glimpse here and there of someone leaving the house at all sorts of hours in the morning. But, I was never informed of any illegitimate siblings running around. Did he ever try something on with you Miss McGills?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>No.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>That doesn't sound like my father at all. Are you sure you're not hiding something?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>No...although, sometimes I would catch him staring at me.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>Just staring wasn't his style, he wasn't shy.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>I was warned before I took the job, he has a reputation but when I caught him staring at me, he would look away quickly, like he had been caught doing something wrong. I always thought he was about to say something but he never did.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>Curiouser and curiouser. My father was many things but subtle wasn't one of them. One time we were at this really fancy restaurant and when the waitress came to our table he said "Do you like raisins? How do you feel about a date?"</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>So corny, one time I heard him say "Is your name Winnie the Pooh? Because you're giving me Hundred Acre Wood."</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>When he arrived here, he said to me "If I could rearrange the alphabet, I'd put "U and I together."</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>He told me, "Are you a beaver because - Damn!"</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>Back to me! Of course the waitress left and got the manager - well, it turned out my Dad owned the restaurant, and everyone ends up apologizing to him. I think he ended up dating the waitress for a couple of months, which is serious for him.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>You can ask anyone at the firm, everyone thought it was the oddest thing. Other women started asking me to bring their work to him. Any other woman that went to the office would have all sorts of problems the minute they walked through the door.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>Just think, maybe he was in love with you. If he had stayed vertical a little longer, you could be my new step-Mama. Instead, it's just me and the business.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>Aren't you a bit young to takeover the business?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>I'm old enough to tell my lawyer to sell it and give me all the money.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>That would put hundreds of people out of work.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>Yes that would be sad for them. Good thing I'll have all that money to cheer me up.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>But don't you have an allowance?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>Yes, but if I sold the whole business... I could really make a splash! I could start up my own fashion design line. Zig Zags for everyone. Asymmetry is in. Haute couture, Darling, Haute couture.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>I didn't realize you were a fashion designer.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>I'm not but if you have enough money, you can be anything you like. And I want to be surrounded, by beauty. Which means I wouldn't spend any more time with the likes of you.</h3>

<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>I didn't.</h3>

<h3>No, we all had a motive to kill him because he thought of all of us as suspects.</h3>

<h3>Cyanide is not fast acting poison. Whoever poisoned him did it before the brandy.</h3>

<h3>My point is, that it might be easier for us to find out who killed Edward Angler than who killed Promethues Noir.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>And how do we do that?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>We can recreate the interviews. He certainly asked me a lot of unpleasant questions. I am guessing that he asked a lot of the same questions to everyone. Maybe if we put our heads together, we can figure out what he figured out.</h3>

<h3>I thought you weren't going to be involved with solving this crime.</h3>

She grabs a salt shaker from a table and shakes some out on the table while staring at an audience member, then tosses a pinch over her shoulder (perhaps into another character's face). She takes out a bundle of sage and a Tibetan prayer bowl and weaves through the audience, waving the sage while Mongolian throat-singing. She eventually ends up on the stage in the corner of the room. She makes a noise with the bowl. Everyone else is watching in cringed awe.)</span></h3>

<h2>SCENE NINETEEN</h2>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>Well that was a nice waste of time before the next one of us gets murdered. Adeline?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>Oui?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>Oh, I forgot, never mind.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>I have been thinking, we should consider that one of Edward Angler's children killed him.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>But Lionel was an only child.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>You really think that Edward Angler who slept with every woman that was unlucky enough to cross paths with him didn't have any illegitimate children?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>That would make for a powerful motive.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>How do we prove that he is not our Father? Call our parents up and have you talk to them?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>Before anyone digs this up, I think everyone should know that I am adopted.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(The other characters gasps.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>But I was adopted by a nice family and never pursued my biological family.</h3>

<h3>Of course you would say that. But look at your face! You clearly have the face of someone who has lived a loveless, sad life who yearns for a real family.</h3>

<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>If you had revealed who the murderer was, the tragedy of Lionel's death could have been avoided.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>Oui, but a greater tragedy would have occurred. My own death. The only reason the murderer did not kill me is because he thought I was already dead.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>I think everything is beginning to fall into place.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>If you know who the murderer is you have to tell us right now before you're killed too.</h3>
<div style='border: 3px solid black; padding: 8px;'>
<h3><span style='color:Chocolate;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Hr,iyk,yaid. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">He's right, if you know, you are in danger.</span></h3></div>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>I want to know what the commoners think.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>That's not a bad idea. All of you have a sheet with all of our names on it. Check the box of the name of the person that you think is the murderer and stick it into the envelope. Once you have done that, lift your hand in the air and we will collect it. We will give you a couple of minutes to turn those in and will let you know if you are right or not.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>What's the point of that?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>Power in numbers.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>Is it always this confusing in America when you want to arrest someone for murder?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>No, usually people allow me to reveal the murderer by myself.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>You lost that right when you got Lionel killed.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>You did not even like Lionel!</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>I don't like anyone! We should be quiet while the riff raff discuss the answer. How about, so nobody else gets killed, we all go sit in different corners quietly. All of you, feel free to walk around the room, we have the scrap of paper here if you want to see it, and discuss the answer amongst yourselves. You can raise your hand up when you think you know the answer and we will get your envelope.</h3>

<h2>SCENE TWENTY-FOUR</h2>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>That's all the guesses in.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>So who wants to tell us what happened?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>I realized that when I arrived here that -</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>Not you!</h3>
<div style='border: 3px solid black; padding: 8px;'>
<h3><span style='color:Chocolate;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">M,wswb? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Madge, where should we begin?</span></h3></div>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>The library! We all thought Lionel was dumb because he was such an idiot, but look - he actually did something clever.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>Not clever enough to still be alive.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>He told us how much he enjoyed using numbers as words and look. He rearranged the books so that the numbers would spell something out.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>What does it say?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>Quick, write this down 9-20. New word. 23-1-19. New word 10-16. What does that say, if 1 is A and 2 is B and so on, just like he told us.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>It says (the Professor's voice trails off)</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>It says - "It was JP." Your initials are JP.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>This must be some sick joke.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>(TO JOHNNY) Your initials are JP too.</h3>
<div style='border: 3px solid black; padding: 8px;'>
<h3><span style='color:Chocolate;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">TtbsaMM. MMihsn,hrniJP. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">That's true but so are Madam Maple's. Madam Maple is her stage name, her real name is Josephine Pickering.</span></h3></div>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>But it does eliminate Adeline and me.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>Can I finally get untied?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>Does this mean you aren't Canadian?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>Why would it mean that?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>A man can dream.</h3>
<div style='border: 3px solid black; padding: 8px;'>
<h3><span style='color:Chocolate;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Iptsctcasotbtctiotds. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">It's possible that someone cracked the code and swapped out the books to change the initials out to divert suspicion.</span></h3></div>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>(To the table next to the library) Did any of you see someone messing with the library?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>And the scrap piece of paper, we were all forgetting one important fact. That Mr. Noir was French.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>EVERYONE ELSE</span></h3>
<h3>Belgian.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>Thank you. So the note was in French.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>EVERYONE ELSE</span></h3>
<h3>Belgian.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>No, he spoke French.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>Such a shame.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>And chat in French doesn't mean chat.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>It means cat.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>The cat did it?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>No.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>I assume that somehow the cat thing refers to Madam Maple.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>Being accused of murder at my age is quite thrilling, but then again, anything at my age is quite thrilling.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>So you thought putting the word chat - not meaning chat - but meaning cat would be enough of a hint for us to solve the murder?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>Bien sur. How much more could you possibly need?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>So whoever killed Edward Angler would go on to kill Lionel Angler, and injure that Canadian.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>When I became aware that my life was in danger, I decided to fake my own death in order to evade the killer. When I went to take a sip of my coffee, I noticed the distinct scent of almonds which could only mean one thing - Cyanide. So instead of drinking Cyanide, I simply put a blood capsule in my mouth, ate a bunch of almonds and performed my little charade for you. I left a clue in my hand so you could all figure out the crime without me.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(There is a pause. Nobody is as impressed by PROMETHEUS' reveal as he thought they would be.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>Swell.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>So the killer only killed the father and son Angler men.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>Oui, here is what happened.</h3>

<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>We did ask for the input of the other guests. Should we see what they have to say?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:black;'>(The tables should be grouped together by answer (e.g. Tables 1, 4, and 5 thought it was Madge, etc.).

<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>It all started with the murder of Edward Angler. It was actually a bit of luck, perhaps (to Madam Maple) destiny, that helped you murder him in Almont, of all places. Your friend at the travel agency told you that he would be taking his vacation here and so you set your plan in motion. When it started snowing, you were clever enough to wade through the river to murder Edward, stage it to look like an accident, and return to Mr. Noir. I think you've been using your position to get some financial advantages. Mr. Noir underpays you.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>I beg your pardon!</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>So you realized, that during the course of a murder investigation, you learn all sorts of dirty secrets from the people who aren't murderers, but are scrutinized by Mr. Noir. So you started blackmailing everyone you could.</h3>

<h3>That is why Prometheus aired everyone's dirty laundry at the murder reveal. He didn't want to give you the chance to blackmail anymore.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>Exactement! My genius saw right through you.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>So you tried to kill the man that you knew would figure out that you were the murderer.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3>I had already figured it out.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>

<h3>And Lionel figured out that you were the killer when you said you had webbed feet. Because Lionel also had webbed feet which is a trait that you inherited from your Father. That is why he dropped the book when you said you had webbed feet, and why he had such a strong negative reaction to me suggesting he design sandals.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>I mean, that's a stretch. Everyone hates feet.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>Nobody should show their feet in public.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>And with Lionel dead, you could inherit the massive Angler fortune.</h3>

<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>But Lionel knew that he had siblings. He must have overheard one too many of his parent's fights. And when you said that you "had webbed feet," he knew that you were his brother because he had webbed feet too. So he left his secret code in the library, but didn't tell any of us. He was young and found it hard to believe that anyone would actually murder him.</h3>

<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>We knew the killer had to be left-handed because of the angle in which the knife went into Lionel. We knew the initials because of Lionel's clue. You also played hide and go seek with your cat and you're a Leo.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
